 *   Project: LED flashing / ISP test program
 *
 *   Description:
 *     This file contains the config settings for the blinky code sample
 *     which flashes an LED on the LPCXpresso board and also increments an
 *     LED display on the Embedded Artists base board. This project
 *     implements CRP and is useful for testing bootloaders.
